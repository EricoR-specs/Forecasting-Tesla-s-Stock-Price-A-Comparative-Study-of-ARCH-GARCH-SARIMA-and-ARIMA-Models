## Unveiling Tesla's Stock Price: A Clash of the Time Titans (ARIMA, SARIMA, ARCH/GARCH)

**Embark on a voyage of discovery!** This project delves into the fascinating world of Tesla's stock price, wielding the power of time series models â€“ ARIMA, SARIMA, and the mighty ARCH/GARCH duo. Our quest? To identify the champion model that reigns supreme in predicting Tesla's future trajectory.

**Fueling the Journey: Data**

Our data expedition commenced with a year's worth of historical data, charting Tesla's price movements from October 9th, 2023, to October 9th, 2024. This treasure trove, meticulously sourced from **MarketWatch** ([https://www.marketwatch.com/](https://www.marketwatch.com/)), serves as the foundation for our models.

**Forging the Tools: Model Building**

Our arsenal boasts three formidable models:

* **ARIMA:** The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model, a veteran of time series forecasting.
* **SARIMA:** Seasonality joins the fray! This enhanced ARIMA model factors in recurring patterns, like monthly cycles.
* **ARCH/GARCH:** Brace yourselves! These models tackle the ever-shifting tides of volatility, a hallmark of dynamic markets.

**The Crucible: Model Training and Evaluation**

Each model undergoes rigorous training on historical data, honing its ability to predict future price movements. We then unleash a battery of metrics to assess their performance:

**Evaluation Metrics:**

* **AIC and BIC:** These scores guide us towards models that achieve a sweet spot between accuracy and complexity.
* **Error Metrics:**
    * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
    * **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Calculates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
    * **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The square root of MSE, providing a more interpretable measure of error.
    * **Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE):** Measures the average squared logarithmic difference between predicted and actual values.
    * **Median Absolute Error (MedAE):** Measures the median absolute difference between predicted and actual values.

**The Showdown: Unveiling the Victor**

The results reveal a fascinating story:

* **SARIMA Emerges Triumphant!** With the lowest AIC and BIC scores, SARIMA claims the crown, demonstrating an ideal balance between fit and simplicity.
* **ARCH/GARCH, the Volatility Slayers, Face a Challenge:** Their high AIC values suggest limitations. While they excel at handling fluctuating volatility, if Tesla's stock price exhibits relative stability, they may not be the most effective weapon.

**The Verdict: A Champion Crowned, But the Market Reigns Supreme**

SARIMA, with its parameters meticulously tuned, emerges as the most effective model for forecasting Tesla's stock price. This victory is primarily due to its:

* **Unmatched Efficiency:**  The lowest AIC and BIC scores solidify its position.
* **Error-Conquering Prowess:** The error metrics reveal a commendable performance in predicting price movements.

However, we must acknowledge that the financial markets are a tempestuous ocean. No model is perfect, and performance can fluctuate with market conditions. 

**So, what lies ahead?**

This project is just the beginning. We can delve deeper by:

* **Incorporating Additional Factors:** Consider including market indicators or news sentiment to enhance forecasting accuracy.
* **Exploring Advanced Techniques:** Machine learning models like LSTMs could offer new insights.

The pursuit of predicting Tesla's stock price is a thrilling odyssey. As we continue to refine our models and explore new techniques, the journey promises to be as captivating as the market itself!
